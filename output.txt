# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
You've got an important exam coming up this evening, and you've been studying for weeks. 
Last night was a particularly late night on campus. You had difficulty focusing, so rather
 than staying in one place, you studied in various places throughout campus as the night progressed.
 Unfortunately, when you woke up this morning, you were missing some important exam-related items.
 You cannot find your T_card, and you're nervous they won't let you into tonight's exam without it.
 Also, you seem to have misplaced your lucky exam pen -- even if they let you in, you can't possibly
 write with another pen! Finally, your instructor for the course lets you bring a cheat sheet - 
a handwritten page of information in the exam. Last night, you painstakingly crammed as much 
material onto a single page as humanly possible, but that's missing, too! All of this stuff must
 be around campus somewhere! Can you find all of it before your exam starts tonight?

Following items are hidden in the 5 * 5 mapthere are 23 locations in total
Your starting location will be  ROBERTS LIBRARY   
You are on the first floor of the Robarts Library. It's usually crowded at this time of the day, but today it's eerily
quiet. Only a few students are studying inside one of the study rooms. You better not disturb them. A librarian stands
near the service desk, looking bored and sleepy. There is an empty study room to the South, an exit from the library to
the East.
